# Train-Scheduler

### Description:
In this project, the end-user can use a form where they enter a train's name, destination and how frequently it arrives.  Then this information is stored in firebase and moment calculates when the next arrival will be.  This data is then stored in a table below the form.

### Technologies Used:
For this project I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, Firebase and Moment.js
